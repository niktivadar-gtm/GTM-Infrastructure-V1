# Pipeline Creation

## Purpose
End-to-end pipeline generation from ICP definition to closed deals. This is where strategy meets execution.

## What's Inside
- **ICP Analysis**: Ideal Customer Profile research and definition
- **Offer Creation**: Value proposition design and messaging frameworks
- **Prospecting**: Search algorithms, scraping scripts, lead list building
- **Enrichment**: Clay recipes, data cleaning, API integrations (Clearbit, Apollo, etc.)
- **Outreach**: Email templates, LinkedIn sequences, campaign structures

## How to Use
This folder combines the entire funnel in one place. Start with ICP Analysis to define your target, create compelling offers, then move through Prospecting → Enrichment → Outreach. Everything is organized by pipeline stage, not by tool.

## Key Principle
**Know who you're selling to, what you're offering, before building the machine.** ICP and Offer clarity multiplies everything else.
