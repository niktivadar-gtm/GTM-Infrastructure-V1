# Real Campaign Examples with Annotations

## Example 1: Pricing Page Insight Campaign (Product Video Company)

**Context:** Targeting SaaS founders. Using Claygent + ZenRows to scrape pricing pages and tie video to upgrade revenue.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Uses pricing page data (Claygent finds it, ZenRows scrapes it)
- AI generates content from LinkedIn description + pricing page
- Ties video to specific revenue outcome (plan upgrades)
- Stands out from generic agency pitches

**PUNCHY VERSION (64 words):**
```
Subject: Starter vs. Professional

{{First_name}}—had a question about Starter vs. Pro.

Seemed like Starter is for platform access, Pro is for API integrations with CRM.

Do you have a product video showing how easy those integrations are and how much more sales leaders get if they upgrade?

We've attributed 4.7x increase in upgrades after adding product videos.

Worth a chat?
```

**Original (longer) version:**
```
Subject: Starter vs. the Professional plan

Hey {{first_name}} - had a question about the Starter vs. the Professional plan.

It seemed like Starter is focused on getting people access to the platform and the value for the Pro plan is to get access to premium features like the API so people can integrate with their CRM.

Do you have a product video that shows how easy those integrations are and how much more sales leaders would get if they upgraded?

We've been working with other sales tech platforms to make product videos. We have attributed a 4.7x increase in upgrades since adding the product video to the marketing site.

Would it be worth a chat to make a video for you?
```

**What was cut:**
- "focused on getting people" → just "for"
- "to get access to premium features" → redundant
- "We've been working with other sales tech platforms" → implied
- "to the marketing site" → not needed
- "to make a video for you" → shorter "Worth a chat?"

**Word count:** 92 → 64 (30% shorter)

## Example 2: Vanta Engagement Alerts (Simple But Effective)

**Context:** Targeting sales/marketing people who could benefit from knowing who engages with their competitors' content.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Opens with a question that's immediately relevant
- Explains product in one clear sentence
- Low-effort CTA (just confirm an example)
- No AI needed—just simple, direct

**PUNCHY VERSION (48 words):**
```
Subject: Quick question

{{First_name}}—do you get alerts when prospects engage with Vanta's posts?

We pull everyone engaging with any LinkedIn company page, filter by your ICP titles, and send alerts.

Just confirm Vanta works as an example and I'll send you their last 10 posts' engagers.
```

**What was cut:**
- "Hey" → straight to name
- "We built a platform that can" → "We"
- "you'd like so you can filter them by your ideal customer titles and reach out" → compressed to "filter by your ICP titles"
- "or any others" → implied
- 67 words → 48 words (28% shorter)

## Example 3: LinkedIn Posting Consistency (Taplio)

**Context:** Saw someone posted about a topic, then noticed gap in posting frequency.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Specific observation (posted X days ago, {{days}} before that)
- Infers intent (building brand on LinkedIn)
- Follower count adds credibility to observation
- Mentions specific tool capability (monitor trends)

```
Subject: saw your post

{{first_name}} – Saw one of your recent LinkedIn posts about {{ai_generation}}.

Seems like the last time you posted was {{number_of_days}} days before that though.

With {{number_of_followers}} followers I figured building your brand on LinkedIn might be a priority for you.

LinkedIn's own guidelines stress the importance of consistently creating content. Creators are using our platform to brainstorm, evaluate top performing posts in their niche, and schedule all from one place.

Could I show you how it works sometime?
```

**Annotations:**
- **AI generation**: Post topic extracted from LinkedIn
- **Data point**: Days between posts (shows you looked)
- **Follower count**: Proves they have an audience worth nurturing
- **Situational social proof**: "LinkedIn's own guidelines" (not just us saying it)
- **CTA**: "Show you how it works" = demo offer, low commitment

---

## Example 4: Google Review Reputation Management

**Context:** Local business with a negative review. Reaching out to help remove it.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Opens with specific review (Karen, Roger, showing up late)
- Payment structure removes risk ("only pay when it's successfully taken down")
- Value-exchange CTA (need call to understand backstory for Google)

```
Subject: Review from Karen

Howdy {{first_name}} - is that review Karen left about Roger showing up late accurate or should people ignore it?

The reason I ask is because we help companies remove untrue/unfair Google reviews and you only pay when it's successfully taken down.

Could you tell me over a call more about the back story so we can make a case to Google on your behalf?
```

**Annotations:**
- **Serper + Clay**: Found Google CID, scraped reviews, filtered for negative
- **Specific names**: Karen, Roger (proves you looked at THEIR review, not templated)
- **Risk reversal**: "only pay when successful" (addresses objection)
- **Value-exchange CTA**: "tell me backstory so we can make a case" (gives them reason to meet)

---

## Example 5: Property Management (Whole Offer Strategy)

**Context:** Reaching out to property managers about late rent payments.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Subject + preview text = entire offer
- Self-selecting (either they have this problem or don't)
- Uses their language ("NOI" = Net Operating Income)
- Light AI touch (nearest mall personalization)

**PUNCHY VERSION (52 words):**
```
Subject: Ever chase renters for rent?

{{First_name}},

We reward renters for paying on time so you increase NOI.

Renters who pay on time get Starbucks gift cards they can spend at {{nearest_mall}}.

If we could increase on-time payments, would that be useful?
```

**What was cut:**
- "Hey" → straight to name
- "We built a platform that" → "We"
- "to pay on time" → implied in second sentence
- "Basically, renters that" → "Renters who"
- "could get" → "get"
- "If we could help you increase" → "If we could increase"
- 75 words → 52 words (31% shorter)

## Example 6: Competitor Insights (Marketing Agency)

**Context:** New marketing leader at a company, using SimilarWeb to show competitive pressure.

**What Makes This Work:**
- AI-generated tenure/title from LinkedIn
- SimilarWeb competitive data (proof of research)
- Name-drops impressive clients (Airbnb, HotJar, Justworks)
- Positioned as "first thing we do" (process credibility)

```
Subject: competitor insights

{{First Name}} – I noticed on LI that you recently started leading marketing at {{Company Name}}.

I did some further digging on SimilarWeb and saw that companies like {{competitor}} are taking some of the same digital real estate keywords and space your company ranks for.

One of the very first things we do when working with companies like Airbnb, HotJar, and Justworks is get an understanding of the competitive landscape.

We help companies execute custom marketing plans when they don't have the team bandwidth or expertise to do so.

Would this be worth a chat for {{Company Name}}?
```

**Annotations:**
- **LinkedIn data**: New role or tenure (AI-generated)
- **SimilarWeb**: Competitor overlap on keywords (custom signal)
- **Case study names**: But positioned as process, not braggy
- **Bandwidth angle**: "when they don't have team bandwidth" (personal benefit—less work for them)

## Example 7: Creative Ideas Campaign (Marketing Agency Follow-Up)

**Context:** Email 2 in sequence, generating custom marketing ideas based on their site/industry.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Bullet point ideas (creative ideas campaign)
- Honest disclaimer ("wrote without knowing bottlenecks")
- Offers industry-specific insights on call
- Uses harmonic keywords (showing SEO knowledge)

```
Threaded to Email 1 (3 days later)

{{First Name}} – I was back on your site today and had some marketing ideas for you.

{{Creative Ideas}}
• Paid social campaign targeting [specific audience] using [specific platform feature]
• SEO content series around [keyword cluster] based on competitor gaps
• Email nurture sequence for [customer segment] that addresses [specific pain]

But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks and goals.

If it's interesting, we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the {{industry}} industry for other companies. Especially in the {{harmonic_keywords}} niche.
```

**Annotations:**
- **Creative ideas**: Must be feature-constrained (things you actually can do)
- **Humility**: "wrote without knowing bottlenecks" = invites conversation
- **Industry-specific**: {{industry}} and {{harmonic_keywords}} = AI-generated from site
- **CTA**: "Share what's working" = value-exchange (they learn something)

---

## Example 8: Final Email with Pulled Contacts (Growth Engine X)

**Context:** Email 4 in sequence. Offering value by pulling contacts matching their ICP.

**What Makes This Work:**
- "Last email" (sets expectation)
- Pulls actual contacts for them (immediate value)
- "No human wrote this" (shows automation capability)
- Low-friction CTA (just watch a video)

```
Subject: show and tell

{{First Name}} – Last email. I figured you sell to customers like {{customer_type_1}}, {{customer_type_2}}, {{customer_type_3}}.

I went ahead and pulled them off of LinkedIn for you using our system. No human wrote this email.

{{Contact}} – {{LinkedIn Link}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact}} – {{LinkedIn Link}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact}} – {{LinkedIn Link}} – {{Email}}

Want to see a video of how I did this automatically?
```

**Annotations:**
- **Customer types**: AI-generated from their website/LinkedIn
- **Actual contacts**: Pulled via Clay + LinkedIn scraping
- **Proof of capability**: Showing, not telling
- **CTA**: "See a video" = still low commitment, but interesting

---

## Example 9: Paid Ads Strategy (Email 3 - Dropping AI)

**Context:** Email 3 in marketing agency sequence. No AI personalization, just straightforward pitch.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Acknowledges their experience (ego stroke)
- Focuses on specialty ("that's all we do")
- Mentions changes in environment (creates urgency)
- Optional: Add pixel tracking insight if available

```
Subject: Paid Ads Strategy

{{First Name}} – I was just taking a look at your LinkedIn profile and noticed you have held multiple marketing roles before joining {{Company}}.

In that time, I'm sure you've gained a wide experience in various areas of marketing. Here at [Agency], we have helped hundreds of customers with their paid media strategies and that's all we do.

{{Company_pixel_sentence if available}}

We are seeing lots of changes in the paid media environment and I wondered if it made sense to hop on a call to discuss these insights.
```

**Annotations:**
- **Minimal AI**: Just tenure/role background
- **Specialist positioning**: "that's all we do" = deep expertise
- **Environment changes**: Creates FOMO/urgency
- **Optional pixel insight**: If you can detect their ad pixels, mention it

---

## Example 10: Final Resource Offer (Email 4 Alternative)

**Context:** Email 4, offering resources instead of meeting.

**What Makes This Work:**
- Acknowledges they're busy
- Offers value without commitment
- "decrease experimentation time and wasted money" = specific benefit

```
Threaded to Email 3

{{First Name}} – Alternatively, if working with {{Company}} is taking all of your time, we have some resources on the current environment that could help decrease your experimentation time and wasted money.

Would it be useful if I sent those over?
```

**Annotations:**
- **Empathy**: "if taking all your time" (acknowledges reality)
- **Specific benefit**: Not just "resources" but "decrease experimentation time"
- **Ultra-low friction**: Just say yes/no

---

## Key Patterns Across All Examples

1. **First line = situation recognition** (with data or AI insight)
2. **Case studies tied to specific metrics** (4.7x, not just "we helped")
3. **Low-effort CTAs** (confirm, yes/no, send access)
4. **Value-exchange when asking for meetings** (not just "let's chat")
5. **AI generation used strategically** (not everywhere, just where it adds specificity)
6. **Fallback to simple when data is limited** (whole offer strategy works)

Use these examples as templates, but always adapt to YOUR offer and YOUR research.
