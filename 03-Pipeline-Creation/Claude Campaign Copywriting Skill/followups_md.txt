# Follow-Up Email Sequences

## Philosophy

**Email 1:** They haven't seen it yet → Full campaign
**Email 2:** They saw it but didn't reply → Try different value prop
**Email 3:** Still no reply → New thread, different angle, maybe drop AI
**Email 4:** Final email → Redirect OR offer resources

**Key insight:** If they didn't reply to Email 1, that angle didn't resonate. Don't repeat it—rotate through different value propositions.

---

## The "3 Offers" Framework

There are only 3 offers in the world:
1. **Save time** (efficiency, automation)
2. **Save money** (reduce costs, better ROI)
3. **Make money** (increase revenue, conversions)

**Email 1:** Lead with your strongest value prop
**Email 2:** Rotate to a different one
**Email 3:** Try the third, or go back to #1 with new evidence

---

## Email 1: Full Campaign

**Timing:** Day 0
**Subject:** New subject line (2-4 words OR whole offer)
**Strategy:** Custom signal OR whole offer OR creative ideas

This is your best shot. Use:
- Strongest research signal
- Best case study
- Clearest value prop
- Most compelling CTA

**See examples.md for templates**

---

## Email 2: Rotate Value Prop (Threaded)

**Timing:** 3-4 days after Email 1
**Subject:** NONE (threads to Email 1 in SmartLead/instantly)
**Strategy:** Different angle, same pain

### If Email 1 was "Save Time":
Email 2 should be "Make Money" or "Save Money"

### If Email 1 was "Make Money":
Email 2 should be "Save Time" or show them HOW

---

### Template 1: Creative Ideas (Visual Value)

**When to use:** You can generate credible, specific ideas

**Structure:**
```
{{First name}} – I was back on your site today and had some marketing ideas for you.

{{Creative Ideas}}
• Idea 1: [Specific action using Feature X]
• Idea 2: [Specific action using Feature Y]  
• Idea 3: [Specific action using Feature Z]

But of course, I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks and goals.

If it's interesting, we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the {{industry}} industry. Especially in the {{harmonic_keywords}} niche.
```

**Why it works:**
- Visual (bullets) = easy to scan
- Shows you did MORE research
- Acknowledges limits ("without knowing bottlenecks") = invites conversation
- Offers industry-specific insights = value-exchange CTA

---

### Template 2: Stats/Data Hook

**When to use:** You have interesting data about them

**Structure (from Growth Engine X example):**
```
{{First name}} – I sent an email with the subject "{{Email 1 subject}}" that probably didn't do a good enough job showing you how we could help.

Our system combines over 40 databases into one spreadsheet so your team can see all data instead of manually researching accounts.

For example at {{company}}:
• Your sales team has seen a {{percent_change}}% change in the past 3 months
• Your LinkedIn company account has gained {{followers}} in the past 3 months
• The company has {{salespeople_count}} with "Sales" in their title based in the US today

Besides cute things like this, we also monitor for recent news, open job positions, tech on site, and mentioned in job descriptions.

On a call, we can build a custom workflow for your team to automate outbound research. Wanna make it happen?
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges Email 1 ("probably didn't do good enough job") = humility
- SHOWS capability instead of telling (the data proves it)
- Specific numbers = personalized
- "Wanna make it happen?" = casual, low-pressure

---

### Template 3: Industry Insights Offer

**When to use:** You have expertise/resources to share

**Structure (from Marketing Agency example):**
```
{{First name}} – I was back on your site today and noticed [observation about their current state].

We've been seeing lots of changes in the {{industry}} environment and I wondered if it made sense to hop on a call to discuss these insights.

Specifically around:
• [Trend 1 affecting their business]
• [Trend 2 they should know about]
• [Opportunity they might be missing]

Would that be useful?
```

**Why it works:**
- Positions you as expert
- "Seeing changes" = creates FOMO
- Specific bullet points = concrete value
- "Would that be useful?" = low-pressure

---

## Email 3: New Thread, Different Angle

**Timing:** 7-8 days after Email 1 (3-4 days after Email 2)
**Subject:** NEW subject line (start fresh thread)
**Strategy:** Consider dropping ALL AI personalization

### Why Drop AI in Email 3?

By Email 3, they've seen your name twice. If they didn't reply to personalization, try:
- Whole offer strategy (direct + punchy)
- Different case study
- Industry/role-specific angle (less about them, more about people like them)

---

### Template 1: Expertise Hook (Drop AI)

**Structure (from Marketing Agency - Email 3):**
```
Subject: Paid Ads Strategy

{{First name}} – I was just taking a look at your LinkedIn profile and noticed you've held multiple marketing roles before joining {{company}}.

In that time, I'm sure you've gained wide experience in various areas of marketing. Here at [Agency], we've helped hundreds of customers with their paid media strategies and that's all we do.

{{Optional: Company pixel/tracking insight if available}}

We're seeing lots of changes in the paid media environment and I wondered if it made sense to hop on a call to discuss these insights.
```

**Why it works:**
- Ego stroke ("gained wide experience")
- Specialist positioning ("that's all we do")
- Environment changes = creates urgency
- Optional tech signal keeps it somewhat personalized

---

### Template 2: Whole Offer (Reset)

**When to use:** Personalization didn't work, go direct

**Structure:**
```
Subject: [Pain point question - can be longer]

{{First name}},

[Describe the problem they have]

[Explain your solution in 1-2 sentences]

[Case study with specific metric]

[Simple CTA: "Worth exploring?"]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Scaling outbound without headcount

{{First name}},

Most teams hit a wall when they need to 3x outbound volume but can't justify 3x headcount.

We've built automation that combines 40+ databases so your reps spend zero time on manual research.

Helped companies like yours go from 100 → 500 emails/day per rep with the same team size.

Worth exploring?
```

**Why it works:**
- No AI fluff
- Direct problem → solution → proof
- Short
- Binary CTA

---

### Template 3: Case Study Deep Dive

**When to use:** You have a strong, relevant case study

**Structure:**
```
Subject: [Customer type] case study

{{First name}},

Quick story: [Customer type similar to them] was struggling with [specific problem].

They were [current bad state] and needed to [desired outcome].

We helped them [specific action you took] and they saw [specific metric result] in [timeframe].

Given what {{company}} does, figured this might be relevant.

Worth a quick chat to see if we could do something similar?
```

**Why it works:**
- Story format = easier to read
- Situational social proof (not just name-dropping)
- "Given what you do" = ties it to them
- Still personalized without AI

---

## Email 4: Final Email (Two Paths)

**Timing:** 11-12 days after Email 1 (3-4 days after Email 3)
**Subject:** Can thread OR new (your choice)
**Strategy:** Redirect OR Resource offer

---

### Path A: Redirect to Another Person

**When to use:** When you're not sure they're the right contact

**Structure:**
```
{{First name}} – Let me know if I should reach out to {{employee_1_name}} ({{title_1}}) or {{employee_2_name}} ({{title_2}}) instead about {{specific_problem}}.

Either way, appreciate the time!
```

**Why it works:**
- Shows you did research (named actual employees)
- Gives them an easy out (forward it)
- Still keeps door open
- "Appreciate the time" = polite close

**Example (from your doc):**
```
{{First name}} – let me know if {{employee_1}} or {{employee_2}} would be better to speak about decreasing your finance costs.
```

---

### Path B: Offer Resources (No Commitment)

**When to use:** When you sense they're interested but busy

**Structure (from Marketing Agency example):**
```
{{First name}} – Alternatively, if working with {{company}} is taking all of your time, we have some resources on [topic] that could help [specific benefit].

Would it be useful if I sent those over?
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges they're busy (empathy)
- Offers value without asking for time
- Specific benefit (not just "resources")
- Ultra-low friction (just say yes)

---

### Path C: Value Bomb (Show Don't Tell)

**When to use:** When you can give immediate value

**Structure (from Growth Engine X - Email 4):**
```
Subject: show and tell

{{First name}} – Last email. I figured you sell to customers like {{customer_type_1}}, {{customer_type_2}}, {{customer_type_3}}.

I went ahead and pulled them off LinkedIn for you using our system. No human wrote this email.

{{Contact_1}} – {{LinkedIn}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact_2}} – {{LinkedIn}} – {{Email}}
{{Contact_3}} – {{LinkedIn}} – {{Email}}

Want to see a video of how I did this automatically?
```

**Why it works:**
- "Last email" = sets expectation
- Gives immediate value (actual contacts)
- Shows capability (not just talking about it)
- Low-friction CTA (watch a video)

---

## Sequence Summary Table

| Email | Timing | Subject | Strategy | Goal |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|------|
| 1 | Day 0 | New (2-4 words) | Custom signal OR whole offer | Earn reply/meeting |
| 2 | Day 3-4 | NONE (thread) | Rotate value prop, creative ideas | Show more value, different angle |
| 3 | Day 7-8 | New (fresh thread) | Drop AI, go direct OR case study | Reset, try simplicity |
| 4 | Day 11-12 | Thread OR new | Redirect OR resources OR value bomb | Final shot, keep door open |

---

## Value Prop Rotation Examples

### Example 1: Outbound Automation Tool

**Email 1 (Save Time):** "Are you thinking about how your SDRs could leverage better data and GPT-4 for prospecting?" → Focus on removing manual research

**Email 2 (Make Money):** "Had some ideas for custom outbound workflows..." → Focus on pipeline/revenue generation

**Email 3 (Save Money):** "Most teams hit a wall when they need to 3x volume but can't justify 3x headcount" → Focus on doing more with same team

**Email 4 (Value Bomb):** Send them actual contacts → Show the tool in action

---

### Example 2: Marketing Agency

**Email 1 (Competitive Pressure):** "Competitor is taking same keywords..." → Focus on losing share

**Email 2 (Creative Ideas):** "Had some marketing ideas for you..." → Show what you'd do

**Email 3 (Expertise):** "Changes in paid media environment..." → Position as specialist

**Email 4 (Resources):** "Have resources that could help..." → Offer value without commitment

---

### Example 3: LinkedIn Tool (Taplio)

**Email 1 (Consistency):** "Last post was {{days}} ago—if you're building brand, have you considered scheduling?" → Focus on consistency

**Email 2 (Content Ideas):** "Made some post ideas for you..." → Show AI capability

**Email 3 (Reach):** "{{follower_count}} followers—are you maximizing organic reach before it's oversaturated?" → Focus on FOMO/timing

**Email 4 (Resources):** "LinkedIn resource center with posts from 30+ niches..." → Offer templates

---

## Key Principles

1. **Don't repeat the same angle** - They ignored it once, they'll ignore it again
2. **Each email should add new information** - New idea, new data, new offer
3. **Progressively lower the barrier** - Email 1 asks for meeting → Email 4 just offers resources
4. **Know when to stop** - Email 4 is the final email. After that, wait 90 days or move on
5. **Thread strategically** - Email 2 threads (keeps context), Email 3 starts fresh (resets attention)

---

## When to Stop

After Email 4, if still no reply:
- ❌ Don't send Email 5
- ❌ Don't try a "funny" breakup email
- ✅ Mark them for re-engagement in 90 days (with NEW signal)
- ✅ Move to next prospect

**Remember:** Your goal is replies, not persistence awards.

If 4 emails with different angles didn't work, either:
1. They're not in market
2. Your targeting was off
3. They're not the decision maker

Any of those means it's time to move on, not try harder.
