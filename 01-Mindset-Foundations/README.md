# Mindset Foundations

## Purpose
The mental operating system for high-performance GTM engineering. Psychology, mental models, and first-principles thinking that drives everything else.

## What's Inside
- **Mental Models**: First Principles, Inversion, Second-Order Thinking, Outcome-Focused, etc.
- **Psychology Frameworks**: Cognitive biases, decision-making patterns
- **First Principles Thinking**: Breaking down problems to fundamental truths

## How to Use
Start here before building anything. These frameworks help you think clearly, avoid common pitfalls, and make better strategic decisions. This is the "why" behind all your work.

## Document Structure
Each mental model follows a consistent format (see `TEMPLATE.md`):
1. **What is it?** - Clear, simple explanation of the mental model
2. **GTM Use Cases** - Real-world scenarios showing the model in action
3. **Correct vs False Thinking** - Common mistakes and how to think correctly as a GTME

This structure helps you quickly understand each concept and apply it correctly to GTM challenges.
