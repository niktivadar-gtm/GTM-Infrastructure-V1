# Socratic Reasoning

## What is it?
The Socratic method is a form of cooperative, argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. It's a disciplined process of questioning that can be used to explore complex ideas and uncover the truth.

## Why is it useful for GTM?
It's a powerful tool for discovery, both internally and externally. Internally, a GTME can use it to probe into the assumptions behind a marketing campaign or a sales strategy ("Why do we believe this is the right audience? What evidence do we have?"). Externally, it's the foundation of a great sales discovery call. Instead of pitching features, a salesperson uses Socratic questioning to help the prospect understand the full scope and consequences of their own problem.

## Example in Action
**Sales Discovery Call:**
**Bad (Pitching):** "We sell a great tool that does X, Y, and Z. Do you want to see a demo?"
**Good (Socratic Reasoning):**
*   **Salesperson:** "What's the main challenge you're facing with your current process?"
*   **Prospect:** "It's too slow."
*   **Salesperson:** "And when it's slow, what's the impact of that on your team?"
*   **Prospect:** "They get frustrated and miss deadlines."
*   **Salesperson:** "What's the business cost of a missed deadline?"
*   By asking questions, the salesperson helps the prospect articulate the pain and build the business case for the solution themselves. The salesperson isn't the hero; they are the guide.
