# Critical Thinking

## What is it?
Critical thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment. It is a meta-skill that involves using other mental models (like First Principles, Socratic Reasoning, and Inversion) to look at a situation from multiple perspectives, identify biases, and separate fact from opinion.

## Why is it useful for GTM?
A GTME is constantly bombarded with information: vendor pitches, industry hype, internal opinions, and customer feedback. Critical thinking is the filter used to process this information effectively. It allows one to challenge assumptions, identify the root cause of a problem, and make decisions based on evidence and logic rather than on emotion or the "loudest voice in the room."

## Example in Action
**The Situation:** A salesperson claims, "We're losing deals because our price is too high."
**Uncritical Thinking:** "We need to lower our prices immediately!"
**Critical Thinking:**
*   **Clarify:** "What do you mean by 'too high'? Compared to what?"
*   **Gather Evidence:** The GTME pulls data from the CRM. What percentage of lost deals are actually marked as "lost to price"? Is there a specific competitor we lose to on price?
*   **Identify Biases:** Could the salesperson be using price as an easy excuse for not selling the value effectively? (Confirmation bias).
*   **Consider Alternatives:** Could the issue be that our value proposition isn't clear enough? Are we targeting the wrong segment of the market that is more price-sensitive?
*   A critical thinker doesn't take the initial claim at face value. They investigate it from all angles to find the true root cause before jumping to a solution.
