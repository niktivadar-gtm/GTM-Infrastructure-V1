# Second-Order Consequences

## What is it?
Second-order thinking is the practice of considering the "and then what?" effects of a decision. While first-order thinking is about the immediate result, second-order thinking explores the longer-term, indirect consequences.

## Why is it useful for GTM?
Nearly every GTM decision has ripple effects. A pricing change affects sales cycles and customer retention. A new sales comp plan can change the type of deals that get closed. A GTME must think ahead to anticipate these effects to avoid unintended negative outcomes and to find hidden opportunities.

## Example in Action
**Decision:** "Let's offer a steep discount to close more deals this quarter."
**First-Order Consequence:** We hit our quarterly revenue target. (Good)
**Second-Order Consequences:**
*   New customers are now anchored to a lower price, making renewals and expansion difficult. (Bad)
*   The sales team learns to rely on discounts instead of selling value. (Bad)
*   The support team is flooded with low-fit customers who churn quickly. (Bad)
*   A second-order thinker might instead propose a value-add incentive (e.g., free premium onboarding) that still drives deals without devaluing the product.
