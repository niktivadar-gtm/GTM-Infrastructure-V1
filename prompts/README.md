# AI Prompt Library

## Purpose
This is my personal library of high-quality AI prompts.

This directory contains **sub-folders**, where each folder is a specific category.

*   **/code-generation**: For generating scripts
*   **/data-analysis**: For data analysis tasks
*   **/strategic-thinking**: For brainstorming, market analysis, or strategic planning

### Prompt File Structure
Each individual prompt file should contain these key sections:

1.  **The Goal**: What is the purpose of this prompt?
2.  **The Prompt**: The full text of the prompt, formatted in a clear way.
3.  **Context / How to Use**: Any required inputs or context needed for the prompt to work effectively.
