# Research Playbook: Finding Custom Signals

## The Research Mindset

**Bad research:** "Let me find their role and company size so I can plug them into my template."

**Good research:** "What is happening in their world RIGHT NOW that makes my solution urgent?"

The best cold emails feel like you've been watching their company for weeks. That only happens when you find signals that are:
1. **Specific** (not "you're growing" but "you hired 12 SDRs in Q4")
2. **Recent** (last 90 days ideally, last 6 months max)
3. **Directionally aligned** with the pain your product solves

---

## The Custom Signal Framework

### Step 1: Define your "perfect signal"
Before you research anyone, complete this sentence:
**"The ideal prospect would show evidence of _____ [specific behavior/change/problem] because it means they're experiencing _____ [pain] right now."**

**Examples:**
- *Data enrichment tool:* "...show evidence of **manual data entry or incomplete CRM fields** because it means they're **losing deals to bad data**."
- *Sales coaching platform:* "...show evidence of **inconsistent messaging across reps or high new-hire counts** because it means **ramp time is killing their pipeline**."
- *Marketing ops tool:* "...show evidence of **fragmented tech stack or manual reporting** because it means they're **making decisions on gut, not data**."

### Step 2: Reverse-engineer where that signal lives
Ask: "If this pain exists, what would be publicly visible?"

| Pain/Outcome | Where the signal hides |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Scaling team without process | LinkedIn: hiring spikes; Glassdoor: "no training" reviews; job posts: vague responsibilities |
| Outbound quality dropping | Their own cold emails (sign up for their list!); generic messaging; no personalization |
| Tech debt / duct-tape solutions | GitHub repos, API docs, Zapier templates they built, StackOverflow answers by their eng team |
| Market repositioning | Website refreshes, new messaging, updated case studies, exec thought leadership shifts |
| Churn risk / retention focus | Pricing page changes, new "success" roles hiring, community posts asking about adoption |
| Competitive pressure | G2/Capterra reviews mentioning competitors, blog posts about "vs [competitor]," defensive positioning |

### Step 3: Hunt with intent (the 6–7 minute deep dive)
Don't just Google "[company name] news." Use these search operators:

**For hiring signals:**
- `site:linkedin.com/jobs "[company]" [role keywords]`
- `"[company name]" hiring [department]` (last 90 days filter)

**For tech stack / process reveals:**
- `site:github.com "[company]"` or `"[domain]"`
- `site:zapier.com "[company]"` (templates = DIY solutions)
- Footer of their site → "powered by" badges

**For competitive/pressure signals:**
- `site:g2.com "[company product name]" review` (read the 3-star reviews for pain points)
- `"[company]" alternative` or `"switching from [their current tool]"`
- Reddit, HackerNews: `site:reddit.com "[company name]" problem`

**For content/messaging shifts:**
- Wayback Machine → compare homepage from 6 months ago vs. now
- LinkedIn posts by execs → themes, urgency, topics
- Their email nurture (sign up!) → frequency, personalization, CTAs

**For growth/change signals:**
- `"[company name]" funding OR acquisition OR expansion` (news tab, last 6 months)
- LinkedIn: employee count over time (rapid growth = scaling pains)
- Glassdoor: recent reviews mentioning "growing pains" or "lack of process"

## Custom Signal Examples (Real Scenarios)

### Scenario 1: Selling to a sales tool
**Standard variables found:**
- Company: SalesLoft competitor, 200 employees, raised Series B
- Role: VP of Sales, 3 years tenure

**Custom signal hunt (what makes this different?):**
- Checked their G2 page → 47 reviews, avg 4.2 stars
- Read 10 most recent reviews → 6 mention "hard to customize workflows"
- Searched `site:linkedin.com/jobs "SalesLoft competitor" solutions engineer` → 4 open roles
- **Custom signal:** They're hiring SEs to build custom workflows because their product isn't flexible enough

**Email angle:** "Saw you're hiring 4 SEs—are you building custom workflows for every enterprise deal, or is there a plan to productize those patterns?"

---

### Scenario 2: Selling data enrichment to a growth-stage company
**Standard variables found:**
- Company: B2B SaaS, 50 employees, selling to mid-market
- Role: Head of Revenue Ops, 1.5 years tenure

**Custom signal hunt:**
- Pulled their LinkedIn → bio says "Building scalable GTM systems"
- Checked recent posts → shared a thread 3 weeks ago about "messy CRM data slowing down pipeline review"
- Searched job board → hiring 2 SDRs, 1 AE
- Signed up for their product → email nurture was generic (no firmographic personalization)
- **Custom signal:** They're scaling outbound but their own personalization is generic—proof of tooling gap

**Email angle:** "Saw your thread on messy CRM data 3 weeks ago—curious, have you figured out how to keep lead data clean as you scale to 2 new SDRs, or still ad hoc?"

---

### Scenario 3: Selling compliance/security tooling
**Standard variables found:**
- Company: Healthcare tech, 120 employees, SOC 2 compliant
- Role: CTO, 4 years tenure

**Custom signal hunt:**
- Checked `/security` page on their site → last updated 18 months ago
- Searched news → no recent breaches, but competitor had one 6 months ago
- LinkedIn job posts → hiring "Senior Security Engineer" (new role, not backfill)
- Read CTO's recent posts → talking about "AI in healthcare" but nothing about security
- **Custom signal:** They're behind on public trust signals while competitors get breached—and they're finally hiring for it

**Email angle:** "Noticed your security page hasn't been refreshed in 18 months while [competitor] dealt with a breach in Q2. Is the new Security Engineer hire part of a bigger push to modernize your trust center, or still early days?"

## The "So What?" Test

Before you use a signal in your email, ask:
1. **Is this signal recent?** (If it's older than 6 months, it's stale—skip it)
2. **Does this signal connect to MY offer?** (Hiring engineers ≠ relevant for a sales tool, unless it's sales engineers)
3. **Would THEY care that I noticed this?** (If it's public info everyone has, it's not impressive)

**Good signal:** "You posted about pipeline review taking 4 hours last week"  
**Bad signal:** "I saw you have 200 employees" (so does everyone else)

## Campaign-Specific Research Templates

For each new campaign, define your custom research checklist:

**Template:**
```
Campaign: [Product/Offer]
ICP: [Role + Company Type]
Core Pain: [What they're struggling with]

Custom Signals to Hunt:
1. [Signal type] → [Where to find it] → [How it proves pain]
2. [Signal type] → [Where to find it] → [How it proves pain]
3. [Signal type] → [Where to find it] → [How it proves pain]

Time Budget:
- 3 min: Standard variables (role, tenure, company basics)
- 7 min: Hunt for at least 1 of the 3 custom signals above
```

**Example for ABM tool campaign:**
```
Campaign: ABM orchestration platform
ICP: VP Marketing at Series B+ SaaS (50–200 employees)
Core Pain: Running generic demand gen when they need account-specific plays

Custom Signals to Hunt:
1. Content strategy → Blog/resources page → Generic "top of funnel" content, no named case studies with logos
2. Event strategy → Check their event pages → Open webinars vs. closed executive dinners (ABM indicator)
3. Paid ads → Facebook Ad Library → Broad targeting vs. account-specific creative
4. Community presence → LinkedIn posts → Talking about "MQLs" vs. "pipeline from target accounts"

Time Budget:
- 3 min: LinkedIn (role, tenure, recent posts)
- 7 min: Hunt their content + event + ads footprint
```

## Red Flags (When NOT to Send)

If after 10 minutes you can't find a custom signal:
- ❌ Don't send a generic email "just to hit volume"
- ❌ Don't make up a signal or assume pain
- ✅ Mark them as "needs more research" and move on
- ✅ Revisit in 30–60 days when something changes

**The rule:** If you can't point to a specific, recent, public signal that connects to your offer, you're not ready to email them yet.

## Skill Integration

When using this research playbook:
1. **Before drafting:** Complete the "perfect signal" sentence for your campaign
2. **During research:** Spend 6–7 minutes hunting that custom signal
3. **In the email:** Lead with the custom signal in the first line (using {{custom_signal}} variable)
4. **In QA:** Verify the signal is specific, recent, and directionally aligned with your offer
