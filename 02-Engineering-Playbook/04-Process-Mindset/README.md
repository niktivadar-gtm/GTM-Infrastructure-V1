# Process & Mindset

## Purpose
How to think and work like an engineer. The mental frameworks and processes that make you effective at building GTM systems.

## What's Inside
- **Engineering Mindset**: Scientific method, hypothesis-driven testing, systematic thinking
- **Iteration Strategy**: Testing frameworks, feedback loops, how to move fast
- **Troubleshooting**: Root cause analysis, debugging methodologies, error handling
- **Documentation**: How to document systems for yourself and others
- **Problem-Solving Frameworks**: Structured approaches to technical challenges

## Why This Matters
Having the right process means:
- You solve problems faster
- You build more reliable systems
- You iterate quickly without breaking things
- You create maintainable solutions, not spaghetti code

The difference between a good GTME and a great one isn't just technical knowledge—it's how they approach problems, debug issues, and continuously improve their systems.

This is how you think, not just what you know.
