# Patterns & Architecture

## Purpose
How to apply technical fundamentals to design and build real GTM systems. This is where theory meets practice.

## What's Inside
- **Architectural Patterns**: Common system structures (Input-Process-Output, event-driven, microservices)
- **System Design**: How to design complete systems before building them
- **Integration Patterns**: Best practices for connecting tools and data sources
- **Complexity Tradeoffs**: When to build custom, when to use no-code, when to buy
- **Scalability**: Designing systems that can grow with your business

## Why This Matters
Patterns are proven solutions to common problems. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you:
- Use battle-tested approaches
- Avoid known failure modes
- Build systems that are maintainable and scalable
- Communicate designs clearly with other engineers

Think of this as your architectural blueprint library. When you need to design a system, start here.
