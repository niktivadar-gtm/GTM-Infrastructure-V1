# Fundamentals

## Purpose
Core technical knowledge every GTM engineer needs. These are the building blocks that everything else is built on.

## What's Inside
- **OOP Principles**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts that apply to all tools
- **Database Design**: How to think about data structure, relationships, and storage
- **Tech Stacks**: Recommended technology combinations and when to use them
- **Data Structures**: Lists, objects, arrays, and how data flows through systems
- **API Fundamentals**: How APIs work, authentication, REST principles

## Why This Matters
Understanding fundamentals means:
- You can learn any new tool quickly (they all use the same principles)
- You can debug complex systems (you understand what's happening under the hood)
- You can make better tool decisions (you know what matters vs what's marketing)
- You can build custom solutions when no-code isn't enough

These are timeless concepts. Tools change every year. Fundamentals last decades.
