# Playbooks

## Purpose
Complete, end-to-end strategies for GTM systems. These are fully documented workflows that connect multiple tools into cohesive motions.

## What's Inside
- **Strategic Prompts**: AI prompts for market analysis, ICP research, GTM planning
- **Complete GTM Motions**: Step-by-step documentation for full workflows (ICP → Prospect → Enrich → Outreach → Close)
- **Reference Architectures**: Proven system designs you can adapt
- **Technical Strategy**: How to combine tools into production-grade systems

## Why This Matters
Playbooks show you how everything fits together. Instead of isolated tactics, you see:
- Complete systems from start to finish
- How tools work together
- Real decision-making processes
- Adaptation strategies for different contexts

Use playbooks as:
- Starting points for your own systems
- Inspiration when stuck
- Validation that your approach makes sense
- Learning material to see best practices in action

These are the "worked examples" in the textbook. Study them to understand complete systems.
