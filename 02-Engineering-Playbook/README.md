# Engineering Playbook

## Purpose
The complete technical foundation for GTM engineers. From OOP principles to system architecture, this is where engineering fundamentals meet GTM execution. Everything you need to design, build, and scale technical GTM systems.

## Structure

### 01-Fundamentals
Core technical knowledge every GTME needs:
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **Database Design**: Relational databases, schemas, primary/foreign keys, normalization
- **Tech Stacks**: Recommended stacks (Next.js + Python FastAPI, etc.)
- **Data Structures**: How to think about data flow and transformation
- **API Fundamentals**: REST, webhooks, authentication

### 02-Patterns-Architecture
How to apply fundamentals to build real systems:
- **Architectural Patterns**: Input-Process-Output, abstraction layers, microservices
- **System Design Patterns**: Common GTM system blueprints
- **Complexity Tradeoffs**: When to build custom vs use no-code
- **Integration Patterns**: How to connect disparate tools
- **Scalability Principles**: Designing for growth

### 03-Playbooks
End-to-end strategies connecting multiple tools into cohesive systems:
- **Strategic Prompts**: AI prompts for market analysis, planning, decision-making
- **Complete GTM Motions**: Documentation for full workflows (prospecting → close)
- **Technical Strategy Documents**: How to combine tools into production-grade systems
- **Reference Architectures**: Proven system designs for common GTM needs

### 04-Process-Mindset
How to think and work like an engineer:
- **Engineering Mindset**: Scientific method, systematic debugging, hypothesis-driven testing
- **Iteration Strategy**: Testing frameworks, feedback loops, speed to iterative wins
- **Troubleshooting**: Root cause analysis, rubber duck debugging
- **Documentation**: How to document systems for maintainability
- **Problem-Solving Frameworks**: How to approach technical challenges

## How to Use

**Learning Path:**
1. Start with **Fundamentals** to build your technical foundation
2. Move to **Patterns-Architecture** to learn how to apply those fundamentals
3. Study **Playbooks** to see complete systems in action
4. Develop **Process-Mindset** to work efficiently and systematically

**When Building:**
1. Use **Process-Mindset** to frame the problem
2. Reference **Patterns-Architecture** to design the solution
3. Apply **Fundamentals** to implement it correctly
4. Learn from **Playbooks** for inspiration and proven approaches

## Key Principle

**Process First, Tools Second.** Always design the workflow before selecting tools. This prevents tool prison and Frankenstein's Monster solutions. Start with the outcome, design the system, then choose the simplest tools that achieve it.
