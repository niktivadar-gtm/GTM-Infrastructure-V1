# n8n Workflows

## Purpose

This is my collection of automation workflows built on [n8n](https://n8n.io/). These workflows are designed to eliminate manual GTM and sales tasks, connect different tools, and create more efficient processes.

## Structure

Each workflow is a solution to a specific automation problem, categorized below. The workflow itself should be exported from n8n as a `.json` file and placed in this directory, with corresponding documentation.
