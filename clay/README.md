# Clay Recipes & Principles

## Purpose

This directory holds all my projects, snippets, and best practices for [Clay](https://www.clay.com/). It's the central spot for anything related to data enrichment and building targeted lead lists at scale.

---

## Structure

This directory is organized into two main parts:

1.  **[Principles](./principles/):** This subfolder contains the guiding principles and strategies for creating effective, scalable, and cost-efficient Clay tables. These are the "rules of the road" for any project.

2.  **Recipes:** The root of this `clay` directory is for distinct Clay recipes and projects. Each recipe should be documented using the **[../../TEMPLATE.md](../../TEMPLATE.md)** to explain the problem it solves and how it works.
