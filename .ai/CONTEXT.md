# Repository Context for AI Agents

## Purpose
This repository serves as a **High-Performance Database** and **Portfolio** for a top-tier Go-to-Market (GTM) Engineer. It is designed to be an outcome-focused library of tools, strategies, mental models, and automations.

## Core Philosophy: Outcome > Tool
The structure is organized by **Goal/Outcome**, not by the specific tool used.
- **Wrong:** "I need an n8n workflow."
- **Right:** "I need to enrich leads." (Look in `04-Pipeline-Creation/Enrichment`)
