# Vibe Coding

## Purpose

This is the workshop. The lab. The garage.

This directory is for experimental code, half-baked ideas, and creative GTM engineering projects that aren't fully polished yet. It's a space to play with new technologies, test a hypothesis, or just build something for the fun of it.

## Structure

There is no rigid structure here.

It's a free-form area for creativity. The only rule is that each "vibe" or experiment should get its own sub-folder to keep things from getting too chaotic.
