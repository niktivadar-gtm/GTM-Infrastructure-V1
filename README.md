# GTM Engineer's Playbook & Toolkit

This repository is my professional toolkit and personal "second brain" as a Go-to-Market (GTM) Engineer. It's where I build, store, and refine the systems I use to make GTM and sales teams faster, smarter, and more effective.

It's here for me to organize my best work, and it's here for you to see what I can do. Whether you're a fellow GTME looking for ideas or a hiring manager looking for your next team member, welcome.

## Featured Playbook: Automated Prospecting

To see how I connect individual tools into a full strategy, start here.

*   **[Playbook: Automated Prospecting & First Touch](./playbooks/README.md)**: A system for identifying high-value prospects and initiating personalized outreach, combining data enrichment and automation.

## How I Work (And How to Use This Repo)

I frame every asset as a solution to a specific problem. For each piece of code, workflow, or prompt, I use a simple `Problem-Solution-Impact` model.

You can use this structure for your own work by grabbing the **[TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md)** file.
