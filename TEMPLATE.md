### What's the Problem?
*(Describe the pain point. What was slow, inefficient, or ineffective? Be specific. e.g., "Our sales team was spending 2 hours a day manually copy-pasting lead data from LinkedIn to our CRM.")*

### How This Solves It
*(Explain what this asset is and what it does. Keep it simple. e.g., "This is an n8n workflow that uses the n8n browser extension to grab profile data from a LinkedIn page and automatically create a new contact in our HubSpot CRM, mapping the correct fields.")*

### The Impact (The "So What?")
*(What's the result? Use numbers if you can. e.g., "This saves each rep 10 hours a week, eliminated manual data entry errors, and lets them focus on actually selling.")*

### How to Use It
*(Optional but recommended: Add brief, clear instructions or key "gotchas" for yourself or others. e.g., "You'll need to have your HubSpot API key set up as a credential in n8n. The LinkedIn cookie is valid for 90 days.")*
