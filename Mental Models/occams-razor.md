# Occam's Razor

## What is it?
Occam's Razor is the principle that when confronted with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the one that makes the fewest assumptions. In simpler terms, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.

## Why is it useful for GTM?
GTM strategies can become incredibly complex, with convoluted funnels, multi-touch attribution models, and dozens of tools. Occam's Razor is a powerful reminder to seek simplicity. Is the complex, 10-step process really better than a simple, direct one? Is the expensive new tool actually necessary, or can we achieve the same outcome with what we already have?

## Example in Action
**Problem:** "Our conversion rate on the website is low."
**Complex Hypothesis:** "Our branding isn't resonating, the CTA button color is wrong, we need a different font, and our ad copy needs a complete overhaul based on a new persona." (Many assumptions).
**Simple Hypothesis:** "The signup form has too many fields." (One assumption).
**Occam's Razor:** Test the simple hypothesis first. Reducing the form from 10 fields to 3 is much easier and more likely to have a significant impact than redesigning the entire brand.
