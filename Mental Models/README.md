# Mental Models for GTM Engineering

This directory contains a collection of key mental models for strategic thinking in Go-to-Market (GTM) engineering. These frameworks help guide decisions, from analyzing a market to building a sales process.

Each model has its own file containing a definition, its application to GTM, and a practical example.

## The Models

*   [**First Principles Thinking**](./first-principles.md) - Breaking down problems to their fundamental truths.
*   [**Second-Order Consequences**](./second-order-consequences.md) - Thinking about the "and then what?" effects of a decision.
*   [**Outcome-Focused Thinking**](./outcome-focused.md) - Working backward from a desired, measurable outcome.
*   [**Occam's Razor**](./occams-razor.md) - The simplest explanation is usually the right one.
*   [**The Map is Not the Territory**](./map-is-not-the-territory.md) - The representation of a thing is not the thing itself.
*   [**The Scientific Method**](./scientific-method.md) - Acquiring knowledge through experimentation and hypothesis testing.
*   [**Darwinian Evolution (Adaptation)**](./darwinian-evolution.md) - Building an adaptable GTM motion that evolves with the market.
*   [**Socratic Reasoning**](./socratic-reasoning.md) - Using disciplined questioning to explore complex ideas.
*   [**Essentialism**](./essentialism.md) - The disciplined pursuit of less, but better.
*   [**Inversion**](./inversion.md) - Approaching a problem backward to avoid failure.
*   [**Critical Thinking**](./critical-thinking.md) - The objective analysis and evaluation of an issue to form a judgment.
