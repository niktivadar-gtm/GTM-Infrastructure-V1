# Outcome-Focused Thinking

## What is it?
This model prioritizes defining and working backward from a desired, measurable outcome. Instead of getting caught up in processes or tasks, the focus is always on the end result.

## Why is it useful for GTM?
It's easy to get lost in "vanity metrics" (e.g., website traffic, number of demos) that don't directly lead to revenue. An outcome-focused GTME defines the real goal (e.g., "Increase pipeline from the enterprise segment by 20%") and ensures all activities are relentlessly prioritized to achieve that specific outcome.

## Example in Action
**Goal:** "We need to improve our marketing."
**Activity-Focused:** "Let's post more on social media, write more blog posts, and run a new ad campaign." (Lots of work, uncertain results).
**Outcome-Focused:**
*   **Desired Outcome:** "Generate 50 new SQLs (Sales Qualified Leads) from the finance industry this quarter."
*   **Working Backwards:** What is the most direct path to that outcome? A targeted webinar for finance professionals? A strategic partnership with a finance-focused publication?
*   This focuses effort on high-impact activities instead of just being "busy."
