# Inversion

## What is it?
Inversion is a powerful thinking tool where you approach a problem backward. Instead of thinking about how to achieve a goal, you think about what you would do to *fail* to achieve that goal, and then you avoid those things. As the saying goes, "Invert, always invert."

## Why is it useful for GTM?
It's often easier to identify what will cause failure than what will guarantee success. By thinking about how to *prevent* failure, a GTME can build more robust and resilient systems. It's a fantastic tool for risk-mitigation and for seeing problems that are not obvious when thinking forward.

## Example in Action
**Goal:** "We want to have a successful product launch."
**Forward Thinking:** "We need a great landing page, a press release, and a social media campaign."
**Inversion Thinking:** "What would guarantee our product launch *fails*?"
*   The product has critical bugs. (So, we must implement rigorous QA).
*   The sales team doesn't know how to talk about it. (So, we must create detailed training and certification).
*   Our messaging is confusing and doesn't resonate with the target audience. (So, we must test the messaging with real customers before launch).
*   The support team is not prepared for the influx of new users. (So, we must prepare documentation and train the support team).
*   By identifying and avoiding these paths to failure, the probability of success increases dramatically.
